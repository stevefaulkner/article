I don’t work. I’m an old-world <em>boulevardier</em>.</p>

<p>I drink tea with my pinky extended and I only expend effort on 
anything if it somehow amuses me to do so. For the last few years it’s 
amused me to spend time working on software for helping people check 
whether or not their documents meet certain requirements in the HTML 
spec.</p></blockquote>

<h2>What’s the difference between DTD and schema based checking?</h2>

DTDs are chiseled into stone tablets. And so for processing they require
 stone-tablet-aware toolchains. Sadly however the Web was not built on 
stone-tablet processing so we’ve had to look around for other solutions.
 In the case of document-conformance checking we’ve turned to using 
things like RelaxNG schemas that while lacking the quaintness of DTDs 
are a far more powerful means for expressing certain kinds of 
document-conformance requirements. So it’s a tradeoff.</p></blockquote>

<h2>What’s the difference between conformance checking and validation?</h2>
<blockquote><p><img src="HTML5%20%E2%80%93%20Check%20it%20Before%20you%20Wreck%20it%20with%20Mike[tm]%20Smith_files/ms-e1414048507324.jpg" alt="" width="80" height="80"><br>
<em>Validation</em> is an oldthink word. Use it for when you want to 
make people think you’re a sort of fossil or relic of some earlier time.
 Kind of like the word groovy or <em>XHTML</em>.</p>
<p>Lots of people don’t know this but the etymology of that word 
validation is from the days when our ancestors were mostly pig thieves 
and they were given actual badges for spelling their own names 
correctly, and usually a pat on that back too. Good job!</p>
<p><em>Document-conformance checking</em> is the current party-approved 
goodthink way of talking about looking for problems in HTML documents. 
And do note that we call it <strong>document</strong> conformance and not authoring conformance, and we talk about conformance requirements for <strong>documents</strong>,
 not conformance requirements for authors. That’s because you as an 
author are a human being; a technical specification can’t place 
requirements on you, it can only place requirements on documents you 
create. And related tools don’t evaluate you as a human being for 
conformance to particular technologies; instead they just evaluate the 
documents you create.</p>
<p>Anyway, <em>document-conformance checking</em> has the nasty ugly part <em>conformance</em> which is a hurtful word really but you gotta look past that part and only pay attention to the word <em>checking</em> which is mostly a happy helpful type of word.</p>
<p>So I call the tool at <a href="http://validator.w3.org/nu">validator.w3.org/nu</a> the <em>Nu Markup Checker</em> instead of the blah-blah-<em>Validator</em>
 because I want to spread the happiness of the word checker in the sense
 of doing something actually useful for people instead of just giving 
them a pat on the back. It’s an automated thing which checks stuff for 
you that’d otherwise be really tedious for you to check manually. So it 
helps you. Maybe it should be called the <em>Nu Help-You Checker</em>.</p>
<p>As far as what it checks, it looks for unintentional mistakes you 
might have made: misspelled element names or attribute values where some
 stray character snuck in. That kind of stuff. And it alerts you about 
those sorts of things so you can fix them.</p>
<p>It also looks at other kinds of requirements defined in the HTML spec
 designed to help you not make broken HTML documents and web 
applications that aren’t going to work the way they should or that might
 otherwise result in degraded user experience. Some of those 
requirements are gray-area judgment calls, but it’s helpful to have a 
common baseline-ish set of those kinds of requirements actually defined 
in a spec.</p>
<p>Other words for what this tool does that aren’t yet party-approved goodthink are words like <em>linter</em> and <em>static-analysis tool</em>.
 But the difference with this thing I work on is, the linting rules are 
actually defined in a spec, instead of something, say, Doug Crockford 
(to pick a name at random) woke up one morning and just pulled out of 
his hat.</p></blockquote>
<h2>What’s the difference between errors and warnings?</h2>
<blockquote><p><img src="HTML5%20%E2%80%93%20Check%20it%20Before%20you%20Wreck%20it%20with%20Mike[tm]%20Smith_files/ms-e1414048507324.jpg" alt="" width="80" height="80"><br>
An error is for something that’s clearly a mistake, like a misspelled 
element name or an attribute value that has some crazy garbage 
characters or whatever that showed up somehow and shouldn’t be there.</p>
<p>But an error is also for some cases of stuff that the HTML spec for 
other reasons just says, this must be an error. The spec explains that 
the reasons for some of those other things being defined as errors; 
basically it’s just that they can create certain kinds of problems that 
are not always easy to anticipate.</p>
<p>There’s a long list of those kinds of problems that are defined as 
errors but some examples include markup cases that are bad for 
accessibility, usability, interoperability, security, or 
maintainability—or that can result in poor performance, or that might 
cause your scripts to fail in ways that are hard to troubleshoot.</p>
<p>Along with those some cases are defined as errors because they can 
cause you to run into quirks in HTML parsing and error-handling 
behavior—so that, say, you’d end up with some unintuitive, unexpected 
result in the DOM.</p>
<p>Finally there are some other errors defined for markup cases that 
just don’t make any sense and would most likely only be used by mistake,
 or cases that clash with default styling behavior.</p>
<p>Warnings, on the other hand, are for things that the spec doesn’t 
define as an outright errors but that still might be problems. Sometimes
 warnings get added to the checker experimentally, as a way to test out 
whether they’re useful to you or not. (That’s part of the reason the 
checker continues to be labelled as <em>experimental</em>.)</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="JustSayNoToHTML4">Is there a use in using HTML4/XHTML doctypes?</h2>
<blockquote><p><img src="HTML5%20%E2%80%93%20Check%20it%20Before%20you%20Wreck%20it%20with%20Mike[tm]%20Smith_files/ms-e1414048507324.jpg" alt="" width="80" height="80"><br>
There’s absolutely no reason whatsoever for using an HTML4 doctype. Just put the <code><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</span></code>
 doctype on your HTML documents and make sure they’re served as 
text/html and be done with it. Move on with your life. But if for some 
reason you really want to serve your documents as application/xhtml+xml 
you don’t have to put an XHTML doctype on them—you can can still just 
use <code><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</span></code> like the rest of us.
 (But you probably don’t want to be using application/xhtml+xml and 
XHTML anyway. Again, lose the haircut—there’s a whole world out there 
waiting for you.)</p></blockquote>
<h2>What are the pitfalls for users of HTML checking/validation tools?</h2>

I guess the same pitfalls as you’d running into asking some really 
helpful and really thoughtful person for help with anything: They’ll 
actually make an effort to help you instead of just shining you on or 
giving you a this-pig-thief-can-spell-his/her-own-name badge. The help 
they give you may not always be what you want to hear, or it may be some
 advice that you already know yourself you can safely ignore. Such is

Some things defined as errors are judgment calls. Specs are written by 
human people, not machines. Different people can make different judgment
 calls—“reasonable people can disagree” or whatever other less trite way
 there is for expressing that sentiment. If you walk around this world

<p>Yeah. The best way to do that is to download a release from <a href="https://github.com/validator/validator/releases">github.com/validator/validator/releases</a> and, for using that, to follow the instructions at <a href="https://validator.github.io/validator/">validator.github.io/validator</a> and at <a href="https://validator.github.io/validator/#web-based-checking">validator.github.io/validator/#web-based-checking</a>.</p>
<p>And if you use grunt, check out <a href="https://github.com/jzaefferer/grunt-html">github.com/jzaefferer/grunt-html</a> which is a grunt plugin for HTML checking that uses code from <a href="https://github.com/validator/validator">github.com/validator/validator</a> as its backend.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Any tips/advice for sane using of HTML conformance checking tools?</h2>
<blockquote><p><img src="HTML5%20%E2%80%93%20Check%20it%20Before%20you%20Wreck%20it%20with%20Mike[tm]%20Smith_files/ms-e1414048507324.jpg" alt="" width="80" height="80"></p>
<p>Is this some kind of trick question? I guess the only advice I’d give
 is that you should remember that tools are machines, and you are not a 
machine. (Assuming this question wasn’t asked by a machine.) So when 
evaluating error and warning messages that you get from any HTML 
checker, use your own human judgment. And if your judgment is that a 
particular checker message isn’t really helping you, then just ignore 
it. This isn’t a popularity contest, you won’t be hurting anybody’s 
feelings.</p>
<p>Or better yet if you care to take the time, use the “Message filtering” feature at <a href="http://validator.w3.org/nu/">validator.w3.org/nu</a> which lets you persistently ignore any checker messages you find unhelpful or annoying or just don’t want to see any more.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Currently the W3C HTML checking tools don’t check/throw errors for 
SVG1.1 and some web component attributes, any plans to add support?</h2>
<blockquote><p><img src="HTML5%20%E2%80%93%20Check%20it%20Before%20you%20Wreck%20it%20with%20Mike[tm]%20Smith_files/ms-e1414048507324.jpg" alt="" width="80" height="80"><br>
Yeah. That stuff is on my TODO list. I’ll get to it eventually.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="unknown">What’s the deal with unknown attribute errors? many JS libraries use them, what should developers do?</h2>
<blockquote><p><img src="HTML5%20%E2%80%93%20Check%20it%20Before%20you%20Wreck%20it%20with%20Mike[tm]%20Smith_files/ms-e1414048507324.jpg" alt="" width="80" height="80"></p>
<p>The problem is that the checker is a machine and it’s not smart 
enough to tell the difference between some attribute with an unknown 
name that you’re using on purpose and some attribute whose name you 
misspelled by mistake. If we just told the checker to let through all 
unknown attribute names without checking, then we wouldn’t be able to 
help you catch the case where you misspelled something by mistake.</p>
<p>The workaround is that if you’re using some unknown attribute name on purpose, then exploit the “Message filtering” option at <a href="http://validator.w3.org/nu/">validator.w3.org/nu</a> to tell the checker you don’t want to see messages about that particular attribute any more. And they’ll go away.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Does the validator check for use of ARIA? if so what is it checking?</h2>
<blockquote><p><img src="HTML5%20%E2%80%93%20Check%20it%20Before%20you%20Wreck%20it%20with%20Mike[tm]%20Smith_files/ms-e1414048507324.jpg" alt="" width="80" height="80"></p>
<p>Yes it checks for errors in the use of ARIA markup in HTML documents,
 including now some limited checking for errors in use of ARIA with SVG 
elements in HTML documents and also in standalone SVG documents.</p>
<p>For HTML elements it’s checking against requirements in the HTML spec itself but that are now also specified in <a href="http://w3c.github.io/html-aria/">ARIA in HTML&nbsp;</a>
 as a separate standalone document, with the plan that for ARIA, the 
HTML spec can soon be updated to just reference the ARIA requirements in
 that document.</p>
<p>For SVG elements, my plan’s to soonishly update the checker to follow a similar standalone document at <a href="https://specs.webplatform.org/SVG1.1-ARIA/webspecs/master/">[Web developer rules for use of ARIA attributes on SVG1.1 elements] – specs.webplatform.org/SVG1.1-ARIA/webspecs/master</a></p></blockquote>
<h2>ARIA checking in &lt; HTML5 what’s the deal? Will/should/can it be supported?</h2>

Nobody should be using anything but “HTML5”, and we shouldn’t be trying 
to help them do it. HTML5 is just HTML. We outgrew the whole version 
thing a long time ago now. <code><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</span></code>
 will be 10 years old soon. Common sense won. Here in the 21st century 
we can’t really help anybody who’s putting an HTML4 or whatever ancient 
doctype on a new document. That’s a lost cause. Certainly we’d not be 
helping by providing some way for them to do that and to put ARIA markup
 into their documents and then we tell them that’s OK. That’s called 
enabling behavior, in clinical terms.</p></blockquote>
<h2>When using the w3c html validator to check my HTML5 I see the following:<br>
“The validator checked your document with an experimental feature: HTML5
 Conformance Checker. …” does this mean there is a more stable 
validation tool I should be using?</h2>
<blockquote><p><img src="HTML5%20%E2%80%93%20Check%20it%20Before%20you%20Wreck%20it%20with%20Mike[tm]%20Smith_files/ms-e1414048507324.jpg" alt="" width="80" height="80"></p>
<p>The idea of <i>stable</i> doesn’t really apply here. But yeah there is another tool you should be using. You should use <a href="http://validator.w3.org/nu/">validator.w3.org/nu</a> directly. It has more features and is better in every possible way.</p>
<p>That tool is an experimental tool, but in a good sense. And the plan is for it to always remain that way. The <a href="http://validator.w3.org/nu/about.html">validator.w3.org/nu/about.html</a> page tries to help set the right expectations about what the goals are and what <i>experimental</i> means:</p>
<p><i>The Nu Markup Checker is an experimental tool and its behavior 
remains subject to change. In particular, because new types of error 
checks continue to be actively added to the checker, there is no 
guarantee provided that if the checker reports zero errors for a 
particular document at one point in time, it will report zero errors for
 that same document at some later point in time.</i><br>
<i></i></p>
<p><i>The Nu Markup Checker should not be used as a means to attempt to 
unilaterally enforce pass/fail conformance of documents to any 
particular specifications; it is intended solely as a checker, not as a 
pass/fail certification mechanism. </i></p></blockquote>
<h2>Web components checking?</h2>
<blockquote><p><img src="HTML5%20%E2%80%93%20Check%20it%20Before%20you%20Wreck%20it%20with%20Mike[tm]%20Smith_files/ms-e1414048507324.jpg" alt="" width="80" height="80"><br>
If you mean checking custom elements, my answer is that custom elements 
aren’t yet widely supported in multiple browser engines, so I don’t 
think it’s useful for me or anybody else to put too much of time and 
energy yet into figuring out how to deal with checker behavior for 
documents that contain custom elements.</p>
<p>If/when custom elements do ever become widely supported across more 
browser engines, then we should figure out how to deal with checker 
behavior for them. That’s actually going to be complicated and messy to 
do—but that’s the case for a lot of stuff in the Web platform and I’m 
sure we’ll figure out something together that we can all live with, just
 as we all have together for lots of other complicated Web-platform 
stuff.</p></blockquote>
<h2>What is the difference between the w3c validator and the nu markup checker?</h2>
<blockquote><p><img src="HTML5%20%E2%80%93%20Check%20it%20Before%20you%20Wreck%20it%20with%20Mike[tm]%20Smith_files/ms-e1414048507324.jpg" alt="" width="80" height="80"></p>
<p>The legacy W3C validator is at <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">validator.w3.org</a>
 and its core is built on old stuff like Perl and DTDs and SGML and old 
specs from the 20th century like HTML4 and nobody is actively 
maintaining its code at this point. The only good news about it is that 
for checking any document with a modern <code><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span></code>
 doctype, it actually uses the backend from the Nu Markup Checker to 
check the document, and then just passes back all the messages from 
that.</p>
<p>The Nu Markup Checker is at <a href="http://validator.w3.org/nu/">validator.w3.org/nu</a>
 and it’s built on slightly less old stuff like Java and RelaxNG and on 
specs from the current century like “HTML5” and has the big advantage of
 actually being actively maintained. And it has more features, like the 
“Message filtering” feature that lets you filter out message you don’t 
want to see.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Checking the source code versus the HTML DOM output, one better? issues?</h2>
<blockquote><p><img src="HTML5%20%E2%80%93%20Check%20it%20Before%20you%20Wreck%20it%20with%20Mike[tm]%20Smith_files/ms-e1414048507324.jpg" alt="" width="80" height="80"></p>
<p>I guess there’s good use cases for both. A limitation with checking the DOM is that at <a href="http://validator.w3.org/nu">validator.w3.org/nu</a>
 itself we can’t really provide a way to have it go grab the DOM of some
 arbitary HTML document on the Web and then check that. There needs to 
be a browser engine somewhere in between to actually parse the document 
into a DOM representation in memory and execute your JavaScript on that 
and then serialize that resulting DOM back out to a text representation 
you can feed to a checker. But if you have an HTML document you want to 
check and you actually open it in your browser you can then use 
something like the bookmarklet at <a href="http://codepen.io/stevef/full/LasCJ/">codepen.io/stevef/full/LasCJ</a> to send the serialized DOM from that document to <a href="http://validator.w3.org/nu/">validator.w3.org/nu</a> for checking.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Should pre-HTML5 doctypes be flagged with a warning, in the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Validator</a>, now <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/">HTML5</a> is a REC?</h2>

I dunno, maybe. On the one hand there are gazillions of existing 
documents out there with older doctypes that are working just fine the 
way they are now, so no reason to screw with them. On the other hand, if
 somebody’s actually taking time to run one of those documents through 
an HTML checker, then they may be doing that for some good reason and 
maybe we would be helping by alerting them to obsolete doctype in there 
so they can go in an update it.</p></blockquote>

I have no idea. I’m not a WCAG expert and I’ve never even read the WCAG 
2.0 spec. And the HTML checker is not a WCAG checker. Or at least it 
doesn’t claim to be.</p></blockquote>

WCAG 2.0 has a success criterion that requires <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#ensure-compat-parses">markup documents have no parsing errors</a>. The <a href="http://validator.w3.org/nu/">nu markup checker</a> flags parsing errors along with other machine checkable <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/introduction.html#conformance-requirements-for-authors">HTML conformance criteria</a>. We have created a <a href="http://validator.w3.org/nu/about.html#extras">WCAG 2.0 Parsing error bookmarklet</a> that filters the results from the nu markup checker to only display parsing errors/warnings.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> this bookmarklet is experimental and not <em>the law</em>
 and even when filtered some of the errors/warnings displayed may not 
have any practical negative effect on the accessibility of the document.
 It is provided as an aid to filter out <em>some</em> of the irrelevant (to WCAG) issues only. Mike and I have talked about providing the filter as a built in feature of the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/nu/">nu markup checker</a>, so hope to make that happen.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Will there be a valid HTML5 icon?</h2>
<blockquote><p><img src="HTML5%20%E2%80%93%20Check%20it%20Before%20you%20Wreck%20it%20with%20Mike[tm]%20Smith_files/ms-e1414048507324.jpg" alt="" width="80" height="80"></p>
<p>No, there won’t be a Valid HTML icon any time soon and likely not ever.</p>
<p>The reason is basically that “This is valid” icons/badges promote the
 idea that there’s significant value in making public claims of 
pass/fail document-conformance requirements in standards.</p>
<p>But the HTML5 checker is by design not intended to encourage anybody 
to use it as a means to make public assertions of simple pass/fail 
conformance of any documents to any particular specifications; it’s 
intended solely as a checker — for people to use to catch unintended 
mistakes in documents and fix them — not as a pass/fail certification 
mechanism.</p>
<p>There won’t be any proper Valid HTML5 icon forthcoming, so if you’d 
like to use one in your content, you’ll probably need to create one on 
your own.</p></blockquote>
